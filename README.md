# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test

A small-scale web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created on **April 20, 2024** as part of a personal training exercise. The project simulates a typing speed test with three difficulty levels, where the user must type displayed words correctly within a limited time.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project was built by following a **YouTube** tutorial. While the design is not original, the implementation was done entirely by me as a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of JavaScript — including dynamic HTML element creation, DOM injection, and working with various data types and structures.
